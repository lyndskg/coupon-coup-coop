# coupon-coup-coop

coupon-coup-coop will be implemented as either a Google Chrome extension, or as a web app. 

Unlike existing e-coupon-clipping sites today, coupon-coup-coop will only coup up REAL coupons to put in its coop. 

It filters out all the expired codes, the bs "no code necessary" shit -- especially for ML-flagged hostnames and/or e-retailers and/or coupon code descriptions and/or links that attempt to redirect you to the retailer's website whenever you search up coupons for item(s) they sell on your favorite browser.
